- 👀 I’m interested in aviation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some basic projects!

I am a Technical High School for Computer Science student and my favourite class is programming (web/c++ classes)

My dream is to become a game developer but for now I'm starting small with playing around in HTML/CSS and learning JavaScript. After that im planning on taking a course on C# and CS to work with the Unity Game Engine and create some basic but cool games!
