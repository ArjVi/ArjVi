<h2>⚡️ About me </h2>
<img align="right" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/giphy.gif" />
- 👀 I’m interested in aviation! <br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS <br>

I am a Technical High School for Computer Science student and my favourite class is programming (web/c++ classes)

My dream is to become a game developer but for now I'm starting small with playing around in HTML/CSS and learning JavaScript. After that im planning on taking a course on C# and CS to work with the Unity Game Engine and create some basic but cool games!

<h2>🚀 To the moon!</h2>
