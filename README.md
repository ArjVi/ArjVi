<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I’m @ArjVi</h1>

---

- 👀 I’m interested in aviation!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS and attending CS50 course
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some basic projects!

My dream is to become a game developer but for now I'm starting small with playing around in HTML/CSS and some basic JS and also attending the CS50 Course. After that im planning on taking a course on C# to work with the Unity Game Engine and create some basic but cool games!
